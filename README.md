# Budget App (Currently in progress)

View app here: https://polinetuch.github.io/budget-app/

This is a frontend web application, which allows manage and store their income and expenses. Users can:
   1. Select options: expense ' - '  or income ' + ' 
   2. Add a description
   3. Enter value of income or expense

All the income and expense will be total and display in the UI. For each expense entered, the value will be deducted from the income value

This application also showcasing my skill in Javascript in regards to implementing Closures and how each method/function in a function can be accessed when the execution stack is completed 

### This is pure Javascript based application including HTML and CSS.
